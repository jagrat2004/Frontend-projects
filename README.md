**Frontend Exercises & Projects**

This repository is a collection of HTML, CSS and JavaScript lessons and small projects — exercises from a frontend course and several finished challenge projects. Each folder contains a self-contained lesson or project (usually with an `index.html`, optional `style.css` and JavaScript files).

**How To View**
- **Open in editor:** Open the `frontend` folder in VS Code or any editor.
- **Open in browser:** Double-click any `index.html` file in a project's folder.
- **Serve locally (recommended):** Start a simple static server in the `frontend` folder.

If you use VS Code, the Live Server extension works well: right-click an `index.html` and choose "Open with Live Server".

**Top-Level Structure**
- **Lessons:** Numbered lesson folders such as `2.1+Heading+Element`, `5.1. Adding CSS`, `9.0+Display+Flex`, etc.
- **Projects:** Folders named like `Simon+Game+Challenge+Completed`, `Drum+Kit+Completed`, `Dicee+Challenge+-+Starting+Files`, `weather project`, `AMAZON CLONE`, `Portfolio`, and more.
- **Bootstrap:** `11.0+Bootstrap+Intro`, `11.2+Bootstrap+Components`, `11.3+TinDog+Project` (Bootstrap-based examples).

**Tips & Conventions**
- Each project is self-contained — look for `index.html` as the entry file.
- Keep assets (images, sounds, fonts) in a local `assets/` or `sounds/` directory inside the project folder.
- When adding a new project, use a descriptive folder name and include a short README inside the project folder explaining how to run it.
